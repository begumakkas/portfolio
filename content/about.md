Hi there,

I’m Begum, a graduate student in the MSCAPP program (computer science & public policy). I’m passionate about using technology to strengthen civil society, and especially curious about how people interpret data and make decisions in an information–saturated world.

I work across the stack, from front-end interfaces to back-end systems. You can explore some of my recent work on the Projects page. Above all, I care about building technology that is both responsible and genuinely useful.

Apart from my career, I love cooking and am a coffee enthusiast. Don't hesitate to reach out for a coffee chat!
